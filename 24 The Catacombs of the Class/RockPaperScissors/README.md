# Rock-Paper-Scissors

This is a challenge from [The C# Player's Guide by RB Whitaker, 5e](https://csharpplayersguide.com/). It is from Level 24 *The Catacombs of the Class* focusing on gaining practice creating classes and doing object-oriented design.

Below is the challenge description:

## ⚔ Boss Battle: Rock-Paper-Scissors [150 XP]
The first design pedestal requires you to provide an object-oriented design — a set of objects, classes, and how they interact — for the game of Rock-Paper-Scissors, described below:
- Two human players compete against each other.
- Each player picks Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
- Depending on the players' choices, a winner is determined: Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beats Paper, Paper beats Rock. If both players pick the same option, it is a draw.
- The game must display who won the round.
- The game will keep running rounds until the window is closed but must remember the historical record of how many times each palyer won and how many draws there were.

**Objectives**:
- Use CRC cards (or a suitable alternative) to outline the objects and classes that may be needed to make the game of Rock-Paper-Scissors. **You do not need to create this full game; just come up with a potential design as a starting point.**
