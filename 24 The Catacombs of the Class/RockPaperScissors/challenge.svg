                    <p>The first design pedestal requires you to provide an object-oriented design — a set of objects, classes, and how they interact — for the game of Rock-Paper-Scissors, described below:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Two human players compete against each other.</li>
                        <li>Each player picks Rock, Paper, or Scissors.</li>
                        <li>Depending on the players' choices, a winner is determined: Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beats Paper, Paper beats Rock. If both players pick the same option, it is a draw.</li>
                        <li>The game must display who won the round.</li>
                        <li>The game will keep running roudns until the window is closed but must remember the historical record of how many times each player won and how many draws there were.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Objectives</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Use CRC cards (or a suitable alternative) to outiline the objects and classes that may be needed to make the game of Rock-Paper-Scissors. <strong>You do not need to create this full game; just come up with a potential design as a starting point.</strong></li>
