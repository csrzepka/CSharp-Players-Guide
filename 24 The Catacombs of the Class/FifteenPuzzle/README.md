The game of 15-Puzzle contains a set of numbered tiles on a board with a single open slot. The goal is to rearrange the tiles to put the numbers in order, with the empty space in the bottom-right corner.
- The player needs to be able to manipulate the board to rearrange it.
- The current state of the game needs to be displayed to the user.
- The game needs to detect when it has been solved and tell the player they won.
- The game needs to be able to generate random puzzles to solve.
- The game needs to track and display how many moves the player has made.

**Objectives**:
- Use CRC cards (or a suitable alternative) to outline the objects and classes that may be needed to make the game of 15-Puzzle. **You do not need to create this full game; just come up with a potential design as a starting point**.
- **Answer this question**: Would your design need to change if we also wanted 3x3 or 5x5 boards?
