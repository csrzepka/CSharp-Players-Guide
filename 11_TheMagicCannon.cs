/*
Challenge: The Magic Cannon [100 XP]

Skorin, a member of Consolas's wall guard, has constructed a magic cannon that
draws power from two gems: a fire gem and an electric gem. Every third turn of
a crank, the fire gem activates, and the cannot produces a fire blast. The
electric gem activates every fifth turn of the crank, and the cannon makes an
electric blast. When the two line up, it generates a potent combined blast.
Skorin would like your help to produce a program that can warn the crew about
which turns of the crank will produce the different blasts before they do it.

A partial output of the desired program looks like this:
1. Normal
2. Normal
3. Fire
4. Normal
5. Electric
6. Fire
7. Normal
...

Objectives:
- Write a program that will loop through the values between 1 and 100 and
display what kind of blast the crew should expect. (The % operator may be of
use.)
Change the color of the output based on the type of blast. (For example, red
for Fire, yellow for Electric, and blue for Electric and Fire).
